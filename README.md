## CICD
### Itch.io

Deployment to Itch.io is done via [Butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/).<br>
Secrets needed for a Itch.io deploy via GitLab CI:

|Variable|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|
| ITCHIO_USERNAME | Your username on Itch.io, as in your personal page will be at `https://<username>.itch.io` |`username`
| ITCHIO_GAME | the name of your game on Itchio, as in your game will be available at `https://<username>.itch.io/<game>`  |`game`
| BUTLER_API_KEY | An [Itch.io API key](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys) is necessary for Butler so that the CI can authenticate on Itch.io on your behalf. **Make that API key `Masked`(GitLab CI) to keep it secret** |`xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
